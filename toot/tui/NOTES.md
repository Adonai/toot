TODO/Ideas:
* pack left column in timeline view
* when an error happens, show it in the status bar and have "press E to view exception" to show it in an overlay.
    * maybe even have error reporting? e.g. button to open an issue on github?

Questions:
* is it possible to make a span a urwid.Text selectable? e.g. for urls and hashtags
